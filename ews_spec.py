    Function to compute the power spectrum of *series* using Welch's method.
    This involves computing the periodogram with overlapping Hamming windows.
    
    Input (default)
    series : pandas Series indexed by time
    ham_length (40) : number of data points in the Hamming window
    ham_offset (0.5) : proportion of ham_length to use as an offset for each
                       Hamming window.
    w_cutoff (1) : proportion of maximum frequency with which to cutoff higher
                   frequencies.
    scaling ('spectrum') : selects between computing the power spectrum 
                           ('spectrum') and the power spectral density 
                           ('density') which is normalised.
